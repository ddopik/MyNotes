What Is Agile Development for Mobile Apps ?
==========================================

--The agile approach to mobile app development focuses on customer involvement
-- flexible planning, 
--constant evaluation and — of course — risk management.



Defining Agile Development :-
=============================

---Agile development is defined as the ability to move quickly and easily
-- characterized by the division of tasks into short phases of work 
-- Break down functional requirements into user stories




In an agile environment the phases run parallel instead of following each other. We design, develop and test at the same time.
 We divide the product into smaller, independent, viable parts that can be released individually.
  We can design, develop and test these small parts faster and as a result we can get faster feedback from users and the market.
 If there’s a mistake it comes to light in no time and we can fix it immediately. Therefore, there’s no waste of money and time


Sprint Backlog
For each card you, as the designer, need to estimate how long it will take. The developer also has to make an estimate.
 It’s just an estimate–after the first sprint you will have a better idea of how much time certain tasks will take.
  Generally, each feature will be given a “t-shirt size” (XL, L, M, S) and number of different “sizes” will be put into a sprin


 Agile design :-
 ================
 1--specification
 2--design
 3--development 
 4--testing


 We try to get rid of every unnecessary task. For example,
  we don’t create infinite documentations, but we prefer personal communications
  . We just try to avoid designing something that users can’t use.

---Building prototypes and iterate fast
UX designers have tools for building prototypes from an idea in a short period of time. Prototypes are the best way to try out more ideas simultaneously. 
Some benefits of agile (rather than waterfall) include the final product being released faster to market, 

It follows a team based approach.
It allows you to make changes, add new features and keep evolving with the changing trends.
Testing can be performed at each stage.
Since testing happens simultaneously hence projects can be launched sooner


 On the flip side, it can make stakeholders nervous because of its flexible nature. It is also often misunderstood.
