--->Be Humble, don not think of yourself as a super genius, this is your first mistake
    By being humble, you will eventually achieve super genius status =), and even if you don not,
    who cares! your code is stupid simple, so you do not have to be a genius to work with it.

--->Break down your tasks into sub tasks that you think should take no longer than 4-12 hours to code

--->Break down your problems into many small problems. Each problem should be able to be solved within one or a very few classes


--->Keep your methods 'small', each method should never be more than '30-40 lines'. Each method 'should only solve one little problem', not many uses cases

--->If you have a lot of conditions in your method---> break these out into smaller methods.
   Not only will this be easier to read and maintain, but you will find bugs a lot faster.   
  You will learn to love Right Click+Refactor in your editor.

--->Keep your classes small, same methodology applies here as we described for methods.

--->Solve the problem, then code it. Not the other way around

Many developers solve their problem while they are coding, and there is nothing wrong doing that.
As a matter of fact, you can do that and still adhere to the above statement.
If you have the ability to mentally break down things into very small pieces, then by all means, do that while you are coding.
But do not be afraid of refactor your code over and over and over and over again. Its the end result that counts, 
and 'number of lines is not a measurement', 
'unless you measure that fewer is better of course'.

Do not be afraid to throw away code. Refactoring and recoding are two very important areas.
As you come across requirements that did not exist, or you were not aware of when you wrote the code to begin with you might be able to solve the old and the New problems with an even better solution. 
If you had followed the advice above, the amount of code to rewrite would have been minimal, and if you had not followed the advice above,
then the code should probably be rewritten anyway.
And for all other scenarios, 'try to keep it as simple as possible', this is the hardest behavior pattern to apply to,
but once you have it, you will look back and will say  *_* --->I can not imagine how I was doing work befor
